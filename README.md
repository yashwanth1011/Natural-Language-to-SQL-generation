# Natural-Language-to-SQL-generation

## Project Overview

This project implements various deep learning models (Transformer, LSTM, and GRU) to generate SQL queries from natural language questions. The models are trained on datasets and leverage state-of-the-art deep learning architectures to understand natural language and generate corresponding SQL queries.

## Technology Stack

- **Python**: Core programming language used.
- **Transformers (Hugging Face)**: For implementing the Transformer model.
- **LSTM & GRU Models**: Recurrent Neural Networks for sequence generation.
- **NLTK**: Natural Language Toolkit for text preprocessing.
- **Datasets (Hugging Face)**: For handling datasets in the NLP domain.
- **PyTorch** or **TensorFlow**: For deep learning model training and inference.

## Project Structure

- `Transformer Model.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook implementing the Transformer-based model for SQL generation.
- `LSTM Model.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook implementing the LSTM-based model.
- `GRU Model.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook implementing the GRU-based model.
- `Project Website/`: Folder containing files related to the project website.
- `Project Report.pdf`: Detailed report explaining the project.

## Installation Instructions

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook (or JupyterLab)

### Steps

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd Natural-Language-to-SQL-generation
   ```

2. Create and activate a virtual environment (optional but recommended):

   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```

3. Install the required dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install transformers datasets nltk torch pandas matplotlib
   ```

4. Download NLTK stopwords:

   ```python
   import nltk
   nltk.download('stopwords')
   ```

5. Launch Jupyter Notebook:

   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```

6. Open any of the model notebooks (`Transformer Model.ipynb`, `LSTM Model.ipynb`, `GRU Model.ipynb`) and run the cells to train or evaluate the models.

## Usage

Each model notebook can be used to train, fine-tune, or evaluate models for natural language to SQL generation. The models take natural language questions as input and generate SQL queries as output.

Start by loading the dataset, preprocess the data, and run the training cells to train the model.
